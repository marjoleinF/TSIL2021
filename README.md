# Born-again trees for predicting treatment outcomes

This folder contains my experiments and presentation for Treatment Selection Idea Lab 2021 (TSIL2021).

The file "TSIL presentation.pdf" contains the presentation slides. The file "TSIL-analyses.pdf" contains the scripts used for the analyses.

Abstract:

In the born-again tree approach (Breiman & Shang, 1996), the predictive accuracy of a single decision tree is improved through the use of a black-box method. I adjusted and applied the born-again approach to predicting treatment outcomes, and results indicate that it provides an interpretable model with state-of-the-art predictive accuracy.
